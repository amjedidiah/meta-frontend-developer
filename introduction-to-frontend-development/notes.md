# Notes

## `strong` vs `b`

- `b` is used to draw the reader's attention to a range of text
- `strong` is used to indicate that a range of text has importance
- `em` is used to add emphasis to text
- `i` is used to offset a single/range of text: should be used for technical terms, titles, a thought or a phrase from another language
